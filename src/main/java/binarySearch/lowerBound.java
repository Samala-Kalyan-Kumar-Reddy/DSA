/*
What is Lower Bound?
The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

The lower bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] >= x. But if any such index is not found, the lower bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array.


Example 1:
Input Format: N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
Result: 1
Explanation: Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {3,5,8,15,19}, x = 9
Result: 3
Explanation: Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.
