/*
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
Result: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
Result: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
